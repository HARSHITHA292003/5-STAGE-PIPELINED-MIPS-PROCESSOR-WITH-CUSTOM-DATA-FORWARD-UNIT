# 5-STAGE-PIPELINED-MIPS-PROCESSOR-WITH-CUSTOM-DATA-FORWARD-UNIT



This project implements a **5-stage pipelined MIPS processor** using **Verilog HDL** and simulates it for functional verification. It includes a **custom data forwarding unit** to resolve data hazards, improve instruction throughput, and maintain pipeline efficiency. The design is verified through comprehensive simulation using testbench inputs and waveform analysis.

---

## üìå Overview

The design follows the standard MIPS pipeline architecture with the following stages:

1. **IF (Instruction Fetch)**
2. **ID (Instruction Decode & Register Fetch)**
3. **EX (Execute/ALU Operations)**
4. **MEM (Memory Access)**
5. **WB (Write Back)**

To handle data hazards caused by instruction dependencies, a **custom forwarding unit** is added. This reduces the number of stalls caused by RAW (Read After Write) hazards and improves overall performance.

---

## üß† Key Features

- Modular Verilog design for each pipeline stage
- Implements core MIPS instructions (R-type, I-type, load, store, branch)
- **Hazard detection unit** to identify load-use conditions
- **Data forwarding unit** to reduce execution delays
- Instruction-level simulation using `testbench.v`

## üîÅ Pipeline Flow

### Stages
- **IF**: Fetch instruction from instruction memory
- **ID**: Decode instruction, read operands from register file
- **EX**: Perform ALU operation or branch calculation
- **MEM**: Access data memory (load/store)
- **WB**: Write result back to register file

### Custom Forwarding
- Resolves data hazards between EX, MEM, WB stages
- Avoids unnecessary stalls by forwarding operand values directly
- Hazard Unit still controls pipeline flush or stall during load-use cases

---

## üß™ Simulation and Testing

- Test programs are written in MIPS assembly and converted to binary (hex) format
- Instructions are loaded into `instr_mem.v`
- `testbench.v` runs the processor with realistic instruction sequences
- Output verified using **Vivado Simulator**
- Results validated via `waveform.png` and internal signal traces

---

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Vivado Simulator** (for waveform)
- **Verilog HDL**
